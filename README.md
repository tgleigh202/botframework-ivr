Please note:  This is a Beta (preview) version of software, and as with any preview software, there may be initial risks and limitations you run into, such as a need to integrate with your existing IVR, etc.  We are actively working on and supporting this product and are here to help you in case you run into any issues.  Reach us at ms-ivr-preview@microsoft.com.

# Enabling IVR 

After getting approved into the private preview, overall setup should take roughly an hour to enable a basic IVR bot callable using a phone number.

The following are the high-level steps needed you to enable IVR support in your bot:

* [Optional: create a new Office 365 account trial](CreateOfficeTrial.md)
* [Step 1: Provision a new phone number for your bot in Office 365](AcquirePhoneNumber.md)
   * [Acquire a phone number](AcquirePhoneNumber.md#Acquire-a-phone-number)
   * [Create a resource account](AcquirePhoneNumber.md#Create-a-resource-account)
   * [Assign license](AcquirePhoneNumber.md#Assign-license)
   * [Bind the phone number](AcquirePhoneNumber.md#Bind-the-phone-number)
* [Step 2: Create a new Azure Web App Bot](CreateBot.md)
* [Step 3: Enable your bot to speak and understand voice](CreateSpeechResource.md)
* [Step 4: Enable Telephony Channel](EnableTelephony.md)

Once setup you should be able to simply dial the acquired phone number using any PSTN or mobile phone (subjected to cellular plan on the source phone).
